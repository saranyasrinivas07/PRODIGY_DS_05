# Prodigy Infotech Project 5 – Traffic Accident Analysis Dashboard

This project was developed as part of the Data Science Internship at **Prodigy Infotech**. It focuses on analyzing traffic accident data using Tableau to uncover key patterns and trends across different factors such as weather, lighting, road conditions, time of day, and crash type.

---

## Objective

To create a comprehensive and interactive dashboard that visualizes various aspects of traffic accidents. The goal is to extract actionable insights that can help improve road safety by understanding when, where, and why accidents most frequently occur.

---

## Dataset

The dataset contains real-world traffic accident records with fields including:

- `Crash Month`
- `Crash Hour`
- `Weather Condition`
- `Lighting Condition`
- `Road Surface Condition`
- `Most Severe Injury`
- `Crash Type`
- `Damage Cost`
- `Day of Week`

---

## Tools & Technologies Used

- **Tableau Desktop / Public** – for data visualization
- **CSV File** – structured accident dataset
- **Microsoft Excel / Python (optional)** – for initial data cleaning

---

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Loading**
   - Imported the cleaned dataset into Tableau.

2. **Data Exploration**
   - Reviewed attribute distributions such as crash timing, injury severity, and road conditions.

3. **Dashboard Design**
   - Developed multiple charts including:
     - Line chart for **monthly crash trends**
     - Bar charts for **weather, lighting, and road condition analysis**
     - Bubble chart for **crash type breakdown**
     - Hour-wise and day-wise crash heatmaps
     - 5-point summary box of major insights

4. **Formatting & Layout**
   - Added proper titles, axis labels, legends, and summary.
   - Used consistent color schemes and spacing for a clean visual experience.

---

## Key Insights

- Most accidents occur during **clear weather** and **daylight hours**.
- **Evening hours (3–6 PM)** show the highest number of injuries.
- **Dry roads** lead in both **accident count** and **damage cost**.
- Accidents gradually **increase from April** and peak in **October**.
- **Non-injury / drive-away** crashes are more frequent than injury-related ones.

## Files Included

- `Traffic_Accident_Dashboard.twbx` – Packaged Tableau workbook
- `traffic_accident.csv` – Source dataset
- `README.md` – Project overview and documentation
